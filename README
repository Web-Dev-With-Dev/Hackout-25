# Coastal Threat Alert System

## Overview
This project is a *Coastal Threat Alert System* designed to monitor coastal environmental data, detect potential hazards like storm surges, sea-level rise, pollution, and illegal dumping, and send real-time alerts to communities, authorities, and NGOs. It aims to protect lives, support sustainable coastal management, and preserve vulnerable ecosystems.

## Features
- Ingests simulated or real datasets (tide levels, rainfall, wind speed, pollution, historical sea-level).
- Cleans and preprocesses data using *Python (NumPy, Pandas)*.
- Visualizes trends and anomalies with *Matplotlib* charts.
- Detects threats with simple ML/anomaly detection models.
- Interactive *React.js* dashboard showing threat categories and severity levels.
- Alerts users via browser notifications and simulated SMS messages.
- Stores and manages data with *Node.js, **Express, and **MongoDB* backend.

## Tech Stack
- *Frontend:* React.js, D3.js
- *Backend:* Node.js, Express
- *Database:* MongoDB
- *Data Science:* Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- *Notifications:* Browser Push API, Twilio SMS API
